    "### What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can analyze data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Machine Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning** 📊  \n",
    "    In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data, where the input and output are already known. The algorithm learns to map inputs to the correct outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**  \n",
    "    Predicting the price of a house in Karachi 🏠 based on features like location, size, and number of rooms. The training data includes historical house prices with these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning** 🔍  \n",
    "    In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data and tries to find hidden patterns or groupings in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**  \n",
    "    Grouping customers of a Pakistani online shopping platform 🛒 into clusters based on their purchasing behavior to create targeted marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning** 🎮  \n",
    "    In reinforcement learning, the model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**  \n",
    "    Training a self-driving car 🚗 to navigate the busy streets of Lahore by rewarding it for avoiding traffic violations and penalizing it for collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Semi-Supervised Learning** 🧩  \n",
    "    Semi-supervised learning is a mix of supervised and unsupervised learning, where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**  \n",
    "    Identifying fake news 📰 on Pakistani social media platforms using a small dataset of labeled fake news articles and a large dataset of unlabeled articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deep Learning** 🤖  \n",
    "    Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to process complex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example:**  \n",
    "    Developing an Urdu handwriting recognition system ✍️ for digitizing handwritten documents in Pakistan.\n",
